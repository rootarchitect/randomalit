This project was made for fun using an "AI vibe coding" approach. This means the development process embraced spontaneity and creativity, leveraging AI assistance to generate code or ideas while maintaining a relaxed, exploratory mindset.

The project is built with Vue 3 and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool, providing a modern frontend development experience with hot-reloading, TypeScript support, and efficient bundling for production.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).
